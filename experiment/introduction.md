## Introduction 

A visual representation of flow of control within a program may help the developer to perform static analysis of his code. One could break down his program into multiple basic blocks, and connect them with directed edges to draw a Control Flow Graph (CFG). A CFG of a program helps in identifying how complex a program is. It also helps to estimate the maximum number of test cases one might require to test the code.
